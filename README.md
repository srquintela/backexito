Backend para Proyecto Exito
This project used the SpringBoot project PetClinic as a template

I basically needed a project I could upload to Google Cloud (app engine + sql cloud), and use as a backend, but alas, no success on deploying to GCloud
To have it running, follow the original instructions
## Running locally
This is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/srquintela/spring-exito.git
cd spring-exito
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access the project here: http://localhost:8080/
